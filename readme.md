# Async UI

This is a simple widget-based grahpics module built around Pygame, as well as support for asyncio.
It passes mypy type checking in strict mode.

## WARNING

This project is currently not being maintained or developed, and unfished.
It mostly works, but a lot of things aren't well documented yet, and it's currently in my project twilight zone.
I'll come back to it eventually, maybe in a few months, maybe a few years, and finish it, but other projects have my attention now.
The only reason I'm making this public is because someone was asking me for it.
